# VillainScope_project
This document explains Villain Dataset "VillainScope".

## Project Outline
This repository is the VillainScope project that I have been working on since my master's degree. I plan to extend it into a relational dataset in the form of a 'semantic web' in the future.

## Project Summary
The VillainScope dataset was constructed by collecting characteristics of villains from works across four different media formats: animation, books, movies, and TV dramas. VillainScope comprises a total of 6,247 words, including 1,593 nouns and 626 verbs. The dataset is structured with six attributes, with detailed specifications shown in Table 1. **(Future expansion using Wikidata is planned.)**

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| Title | Title of the work |
| Name | Name of the villain |
| Genre | Genre of the work |
| Age | Age of the villain |
| Characteristics | Four characteristics of the villain<br>(Appearance, Personality, Ability, Occupation) |
| Image | Image of the villain |
